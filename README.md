# Philosophers Project
The Philosophers project is a C program that simulates a group of philosophers sitting at a round table with a bowl of spaghetti in the middle. The philosophers take turns eating, thinking, and sleeping by manipulating forks that are positioned between them. The goal is to learn about the basics of threading a process and creating mutexes in C.

# Structure
The GitHub repository contains the code for both the mandatory and bonus parts of the project. The mandatory part involves creating threads and mutexes, while the bonus part involves processes and semaphores. The mandatory part-specific rules include the prohibition of global variables and the requirement that each philosopher should be a thread. In contrast, the bonus part-specific rules include the use of semaphores to represent the number of available forks and the requirement that philosophers should be processes.

# Additional Notes
It's essential to follow the program's specific rules, such as formatting the philosopher logs correctly and ensuring that there are no data races. The specifics of the Philosophers project are detailed in the uploaded document, en.subject.pdf. Users seeking assistance should refer to the document or contact the TextCortex support team.
